## Change Log
-**1/23/2025**: Began Website Design, attempted first pass at hyperlink insertion, created first post. Blew up website on accident, reset it thanks to existing data because I am a silly little boy who knows nothing of websites (yet)... was able to restore from a local copy because my commits are a mess for now. Added changelog (didn't see that one coming did you)
