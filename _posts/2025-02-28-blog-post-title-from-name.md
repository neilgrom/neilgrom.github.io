If you know me, you know that I enjoy reflecting on things. From improving a dish I'm making, to remembering good times, to figuring out the best version of myself, reflection is a central part of that.

Having just turned 25, I've had nearly 4 years in the working world along with my time leaving college during COVID. For me, that meant graduating online, moving to a new city, starting a new job, quitting said new job, and starting to travel around the world.

Let's not forget to mention other things that happened on this rollercoaster that's been the past 5 years, such as working in the UK, buying a house, building stronger relationships, and discovering myself.

Now I know it sounds corny but hear me out, this isn't just another half-baked post about how to be the best version of yourself. For me, being the best version of myself _is_ being myself. 

Over the past year, I've discovered my passion for learning and pursuing the parts of life that motivate me to keep living. While it took me a while to get there, in a moment of reflection today, I have verbalized what I want in life.

> **I want to be fulfilled.**

If you had asked me 4 years ago—hell, even last year—what I wanted in life, I would have given you the typical, albeit frugal (shoutout momma Grom) answer. A nice house with a nice car (was never super high but why not, paints the picture), a loving family, and the time and money to do what I want.

However, as I reflect on that version of an idea, it revolves around one thing. Money. The money to be in those positions and leverage that to provide space to make yourself happy.

I had a great discussion with my friend Tony a few weeks back and while I had mentally come around to this point, I'd never heard it before. Tony is someone who has been with me on my journey of self-growth—sometimes driving it—while bringing his own unique approach, characteristics, and views on life

Tony's point was that at the end of it all, it doesn't matter if you have the flashy car and house and money and Caribbean vacations if you can't spend them with people that you love to live your life with. 

I'm attaching one of my favorite pictures that I feel like has really shaped my journey in the past 3 years. If you know me, I'm sure I've already shared it with you. 

This picture is an excerpt from a series of books based in the "Big Panda and Tiny Dragon" series by James Norbury based on the writings of his journey of spiritualism and sharing what he's learning in Buddhist Philosophy.

Okay you better answer! Spoilers in 3.... 2.... 1....


The reason I resonated with Tiny Dragon so much for so long is because I wanted the life on top of the mountain. I wanted to set my sights on goals I could accomplish and look around and reflect on what I've done with a smile on my face.

While a lot of those goals and aspirations are still a focal point in life, my approach is a bit more geared towards Big Pandas.

> It's about how I life my life on the way to the "end goal" that makes the journey worth it.

What if I get to the top and we get attacked by a group of rabid koala bears, unable to fulfill our dreams? More realistically, what if it's a foggy day on the mountain top and we don't even see the view?

For me, that fear became **_"What if I work my whole life for something that isn’t worth it? What if I get to the top and realize I don’t even want to be on the mountain anymore?"_**

Big Panda isn't telling Tiny Dragon "Don't look forward to the top" or discouraging the young one. He's just telling him to slow down and enjoy the trip that is their journey together.

Here's another great one, showing how Big Panda not only embodies the wise-sage Uncle Iroh archetype but also lives each day exactly as they want to... At peace, with their friend, exploring the world.

The reason this image that has travelled with me for so long ties into my self-fulfillment is because I want to live everyday as myself, not as someone I'm pretending to be doing things I don't want to.

While life will always hand you things you don't want to do, I will continue to do them because _I want to_. Because _I want to_ live a life of love, family, and community—and build relationships with the people who share that same love

Because _I want to_ live every day I can as not just an extension of my goals and dreams, but because I am happy to stand here as myself and do it. _I want to_ show up to work with my customers and deliver the best project—not because my company asks me to, but because I want to.

_I want to_ live my life knowing that whatever I do, I do it as unapologetically myself, and that anything less than that isn't something that should be in my life.

So before today when I would smile and shake someone's hand and say "Hello, I'm Neil, nice to meet you" because I was obligated to;

Tomorrow, I will shake people's hands and say "Hello, I'm Neil, nice to meet you" because _I want to_ and because I genuinely mean it.
