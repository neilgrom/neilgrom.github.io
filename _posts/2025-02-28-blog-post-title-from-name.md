If you know me, you know that I enjoy the reflecting on things. From improving a dish I'm making, to remembering good times, to figuring out the best version of myself, reflection is a central part of my life.

Having just turned 25, I've had 4 years as a professional along with COIVD college to start to figure out my life. For me, that was graduating behind a screen, moving to a new city, starting a new job, quitting said new job, and beginning to travel the world.

Granted, that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the last chunk of my life. Some unimportant thing include establishing our products UK market (with free trips to England), buying a house, building serious relationships, and discovering myself.

Now I know being sentimental sounds corny, but hear me out. This isn't just another half-baked post about how to be the best version of yourself, because I'm not doing this for anyone else. For me, being the best version of myself isn't just a part of myself, it _**is**_ being myself. 

Over the past year, I've discovered my passion for learning and pursuing the parts of life that motivate me to keep living. It took me a while to get here, but in a moment of reflection today, I have finally realized what I want in life.

> **I want to be fulfilled.**

If you had asked me 4 years ago—hell, even last year—what I wanted in life, I would have given you the typical, albeit frugal (shoutout momma Grom) answer. A nice house with a nice car (which was never on the top of my list), a loving family, and the time and money to do what I want.

As I reflect on that concept of happiness, it revolves around one thing. Money. The money to be in those positions and the leverage money provides to make yourself happy.

I had a great discussion with my friend Tony a few weeks back. While I had toyed with the idea for awhile, hearing the words come out of someone else's mouth really solidified that idea.

See, Tony is someone who has been with me since the beginning. While our lives are very different, our opinions have always resonated in a very meaningful way. 

Especially knowing what we've been though together, looking back on 8 years not only makes the bond and respect tighter, but the value those opinions carry even more so.

Tony shared a point about life and fulfillment with me that really resonated as something I'd never really considered from my own economic status.

See, as nice as the flashy cars and houses are, it doesn't really matter if you can't spend time with the people you love inside of them.

That's been a valuable, yet weird part of my life to consider as others start coming into play. Starting to take care of people I don't necessarily love is a really big growth moment for me - and I'm all for it.

As I continue my journey to make myself a more loving person, I find myself reflecting back to a certain picture in particular. This picture has shaped my journey as I began to know and love myself over the past five years and I love the message it shares. I'm sure that if you know me you've seen it before, but it's an excerpt on life that I am happy to grow to love. 

The picture below is an excerpt from book series titled "Big Panda and Tiny Dragon" by James Norbury; based on the writings of his journey of spiritualism and self-enlightenment in Buddhist philosophy. As you read this picture, take a moment to reflect on what you believe this picture means to me and the story that is to come (PS there will be a test).

Okay you better figure out your answer! Spoilers are coming in 3.... 2.... 1....

The reason Tiny Dragon spoke to me for so long was beacuse before I can remember, I have wanted the life on top of the mountain. I wanted to aim above the trees and reflect on the mountains I've climbed with a smile on my face.

Tiny Dragon is a character whose life reflects on **big ambition**. The dream to take you above and beyond and the drive to make it happen. As I have identified with Tiny Dragon for so many years, I have finally seen myself pivot towards the perspective of Big Panda. 

> It's about how I life my life on the way to the "end goal" that makes the journey worth it.

Those words, that Tiny Dragon may never understand, are all Big Panda wants. It's not about a life dreaming for the summit, but the life that loves getting there because they love every day of their lives.

These words would obviosuly come as a shock to Tiny Dragon, who often speaks first in these depictions. That's because the naivety of Tiny Dragon never displays the reality of their goals, just the ambition that they derive from their dreams of realizing their reality if that makes sense.

But in this time of reflection, positioning myself as the Tiny Dragon whose whole life was about getting to the top of the mountain, it's taken me years of maturity to take a step back and think about what Tiny Dragon _wants_ versus what he _needs_.

> What if on our journey, we get attacked by a group of rabid koala bears and are unable to fulfill our dreams? On a more realistic note, what if we got to the top on a foggy day and we don't even get to enjoy the view?

For me, that fear of not enjoying the view of a life I'd worked towards slowly became a reality. And that reality slowly became, **_"What if I work my whole life for something that isn’t worth it? What if I get to the top and realize I don’t even want to be on the mountain anymore?"_**

See, Big Panda isn't telling Tiny Dragon "Don't look forward to the top" or attempting to discourage the young one. He's just telling him to slow down and enjoy the trip that is their journey together.

Here's another great depcition of their relationship. It not only shows the embodiment of Big Panda as the wise-sage Uncle Iroh archetype, but as someone as who lives each day **exactly** as they want to... At peace, with their friend, exploring the world.

The reason this image has travelled with me for so long is because of what it measn to me. Looking at a life of not just selfish fulfillment and driving towards an end goal, but the love of life to enjoy every step of the way.

While life will always hand you things you don't want to do, I will continue to do them because _I want to_. Because _I want to_ live a life of love, family, and community—and build relationships with the people who share that same love.

Because _I want to_ live every day I can not just as an extension of my goals and dreams, but because I am happy to stand here as myself and do it. _I want to_ show up to work with my customers and deliver the best project—not because my company asks me to, but because I want to.

_I want to_ live my life knowing that whatever I do, I do it as unapologetically myself, and that anything less than that isn't something that should be in my life.

So before today when I would smile and shake someone's hand and say "Hello, I'm Neil, nice to meet you" because I was obligated to;

Tomorrow, I will shake people's hands and say "Hello, I'm Neil, nice to meet you" because _I want to_ and because I genuinely mean it.
