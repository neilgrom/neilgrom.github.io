# My Week in Food

Hello! You're probably sitting there wondering (probably not) why I'm writing a post today. That's because it's a Tuesday! While my plans for this will ebb and flow in extremely irregular patterns with my motivation like a child who remembers that candy exists whenever he goes to the store.

Sometimes you obsess over something for an hour straight, other times you forget it exists. That’s kind of how I feel about this blog—except I’m making a commitment: every Tuesday, no excuses.

While I don't love the idea of being chained down to a consistent posting schedule, it will help me be consistent with my writing and motivation. My goal is to ultimately make 100 posts this year, which means I'll need to churn out a little more than 2 a week due to my delayed start.

While that outline has been on my mind for awhile to communicate some expectations, let's dive into today!

# Foooooooooooood

Okay I said that I love being home and that's not an exaggeration. While my life is chaotic with all the travel I do, I quite like the time I get to spend at home. With a consistent (ish) schedule, lots of remote flexibility and routine, and most importantly...

**Cooking.**

How I started cooking is a story for another time, but recently I've been big into pre-cutting ingredients for other recipes and recycling past dishes into future ones! I wanted to outline the few things I've made this week and how I've leveraged some recycled ingredients and some general cooking notes.

# 1.) Katsu Curry
I've loved Chicken Katsu for as long as I can remember. Pair that with some Japanese Style curry and rice and boom, you've got a mini tasting menu of different flavors, combinations, and textures all in one. While I've always been good at making the curry, this was probably the best katsu I've ever made and here's why I think so.
1.) I pounded the chicken with a rolling pin -> Flatter, cooked more evenly, sat on pan better
2.) I used **thighs** rather than breasts -> Smaller, easier to cook more evenly compared to different textures/sizes of chicken breast.
3.) I used that rolling pin (don't worry, I pounded the chicken out in a bag, no sa1m0ne11a_dis3as3 here) to crush the breadcrumbs into smaller bits, allowing a more even coat
4.) I active monitored the cooking oil temperature, and after the first batch, reduced the temperature by quite a bit.

All of my cooking experience is slowly starting to culminate in general best practices and tips and tricks I'm learning that can be applied across the board. Along with a little intuition and understanding the basics lets you be flexible and I love that.

# 2.) Wings
I **LOVE** making my own sauces, especially with Asian flavors. I recently reorganized my kitchen to move all my sauces out of the pantry and right above my stove with how much I was running over there. _game. changer._ 

Lots of sauces are just understanding how to combine your elements of salt, spice, and sweetness while balancing depth with other ingredients and the rest of the dish. We started by brining the chicken wings, which is the first time I've ever done this!

The brine definitely made a difference, as we prepped a spicier, salsa themed brine and a sweet soy brine not adding a ton of extra salt. I couldn't make out any difference in texture/juicyness based on the amount of salt used, but we will need to revisit.

For the first sauce, I made a spicy, more bbq + mango habenero based sauce with some different sauces I had laying around. For the 2nd, I did something I'm more familiar with, being a sweet soy sauce based off some teriyaki notes, chili oil, and some Bacchan's Asian BBQ Sauce (in love with this stuff recently).

I made this with some oven roasted potatoes (one of my best recipes IMO) and roasted asparagus and it turned out :ok_hand:.

# 2.5) Chicken Broth
I have never really made my own broth before (minus some vegetable broth a year ago or so) and I realized I had just received a cornucopia of sweet, sweet broth guts. Using the chicken wings along with some buillon, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs, I threw that into a pot to simmer for 2hrs while skimming the fat off the top every 30 mins.

I'll be honest, when I first tried my own veggie broth, it was **SOOOOOO** much better I literally could've drank it with a spoon. I felt the same with this. Just so much more flavor than the store bought stuff with just a little bit of effort for cheaper/the same cost? Definitely a plus.

What didn't work was that I tried to use the broth veggies to make a sort of veggie soup in a blender. NOT A GOOD IDEA OH MY GOD. The vegetables (should) lose all their flavor if you simmer it for long enough so it was very bland. That and I found some little bone chewies in there so no dice on that experiment.

You gotta try if you get curious right? That's the last time I will be trying that with the de-flavorfied veggies, but more broth to come for sure.

# 3.) Asian Themed Steak
I had mentioned the recycling, so here's where it begins! I've pretty much always got onions and mushrooms chopped in my fridge ready to be used for whatever. I'd picked up a few steaks and ran out of the katsu for the curry, so I had an idea.

See, I'd saved the sweet soy sauce, which was the sweet chicken brine, just thickened with corn starch and reduced the saltiness of (yes we boiled it I'm not trying to die, again). I decided that could use a great glaze for the steak I had just picked up.

With the curry already done, I made some spicy rice (chili oil, soy sauce, gochujang, chicken broth, rice -> :rice: 🧑‍🍳) since I'd run out of rice. Then, I cooked my steak in a ripping hot pan with some oil to get a golden crust.

I flipped it once a crust formed, added butter, mushrooms, rosemary, and a bit of that sweet soy sauce to reduce nicely. I moved the steak to the oven at 375 for 5:30mins and then added some beef broth, milk, and pepper to make an asian version of a peppercorn sauce.

It turned out really good! Wish I had some pictures, but I can definitely tell what a cheap cut of meat feels like to chew, I think I went with Top Sirlion and it wasn't the best quality.

# 4.) To Come - Chicken Pot Pie
With all that gorgeous chicken broth I made, I'm excited tomorrow night to make chicken pot pie! It's one of my favorite recipes I got from my grandma where she would handmake the noodles and UGH. Such a great comfort food in the winter without a ton of effort. AND I already have all the veggies from the stock?

Homerun waiting to happen. Now yes, while it is _technically_ chicken and dumplings instead of chicken pot pie, to that I say:

> Haha there's nothing you can do about what I call it so you lose!

That’s a lot of cooking for one week, but that’s what I love about being home. Stay tuned for the chicken pot pie (yes, I’m calling it that, fight me), and maybe a food review from Baltimore next week—assuming I don’t just eat snacks I bring from home the whole time.
