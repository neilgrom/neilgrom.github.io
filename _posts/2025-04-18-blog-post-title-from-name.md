# How I’m Using ChatGPT to Think Better

Okay, yes — that’s kind of clickbait. But let me explain…

Growing up in an era where AI has not only become fairly intelligent but insanely powerful, it's crazy that early models were _free._ 

You're essentially paying with your data — your traffic, and whatever valuable information you feed it."

One big piece I missed out on was using it in school, where students are writing entire papers and esays using AI just because it's that easily available.

The point is: AI is a learning model — constantly evolving based on the data we feed it. But we, the ones feeding it, don’t always think critically about how we’re improving ourselves.

The example I have is I was trying to learn SQL (coding lanaguage for summarizing data) for my job to write a data view for a customer. While I wasn't very good with SQL at the time, I kept saying "hey here are values in a table I want to pull, can you do that?"

Obviously with proprietary data I can't just "throw" our entire codebased or code snippets in there, but I _can_ ask what built in functions it has. 

I can use it as an extension of my brain and say "Hey, I would regularly Google this and spend hours on stackoverflow, but can you quickly provide this syntax for me?" That's what I've been using AI for recently, the _extension_ of my thoughts.

## Ok What do You Mean By That

Well, AI is really good at generating and pulling information for you. But, if you see it as a shortcut or end-all be all, you're going to prevent yourself from learning anything. So what have I been using it for lately?

My topic, as with most of my posts here, it self betterment. Let's focus on a few more professional uses of AI.

### "Professional AI"

I've been feeding some lengthier email to AI to review for quality, brevity, and clarity. It really throws me back to technical writing when I was in community college thinking I'd never have to use that.... Oh was I wrong.

The great feedback here is I can **see** my typing trends, I can get general feedback and overall move towards a more consistent results. I'm not saying I need to be the god of emailing, but being intentional with your communication is important.

Along with that, I've also used it to learn a lot of SQL syntax. We recently converted from Oracle -> Microsoft SQL Databases, so there are some syntax changes. It's great to say "Hey how would this change between the two databases?" and provide a list of terms.

Obviously saying "Hey write this report for me" doesn't make you any better at coding. But asking it to explain why a query works the way it does? That’s where learning happens.
### Personal AI

My mindset lately has been reflective to say the least. Lots of change, decisions, and weighing different aspects of life for how I value them. A big one on my mind recently has been to rent or sell my house. 

While it could work out renting to a friend of mine, I used AI to run the best and worst case scenarios and man I hadn't thought this deep. Between property maintenance, final moving cleanup, and home value changes, the profit are _way_ slimmer than I thought.

Let's say I'm pocketing $700 a month after mortgage (8.4k/year), and gain 4k in equity and my house goes up 2% (6k). That would be a nice takeaway of 8.4k profit along with an extra 10k when I sell it (minus 5k for management + repairs). However, that's the _optimal_ situation. 

In the _worst case_ scenario, I first start by _actually accounting_ for property upkeep. Let's assume we make the same 8.4k per year from our renters. 

Between mowing the yard and fixing things later, let's say $400 a month. Now our profit is down to 4.6k after our rent. Then, let's say the property actually _decreases_ 2%, so we lose 6k in value and the extra "equity" we got pretty much crosses that off.

In that case, we _barely_ break even. That's all assuming that's a reasonable rent price/profit in the market. And that no major damage is done to the house by tenants.

Either way, using AI to get a sounding board for these ideas and estimates showed me that renting out my house might not be the best option if everything goes downhill. Along with the effort to manage the property and a trip back to sell it, there's a lot to consider.

However, selling it right away, minus building some more equity and potential rental profits, actually puts all that money back in play somewhere else where it could _gain_ money. 

Assuming the best case scenario is a 10% growth on my assests, I could sell this and then take my principal and go invest it. And it's a _lot_ less effort. Now same thing, the market could go down next week, but would real estate go down in that case too?

While this has moved to more of a brain dump, it's all been powered by AI. While I had the ideas and came in with my initial assumptions and ideas, I never would've realized that the rental could've been _more_ expensive to keep than selling it in the long-term.

Could I have gotten there on my own? Yes. Did it make my decision for me? No. I gave it the information I was working with and asked it to elaborate on pros and cons.

That's another great thing I've learned is that AI is great because you can _modify_ your parameters. Giving it more information, asking specific details, elaborating on specific topics. 

I've found myself using this sounding board for not only just financial decisions, but to help put life decisions in perspective.

If I moved back home with this expected budget, how much money would I save?

What are some good places for a person my age to live with the following criteria?

What are the long-term vs. short term benefits of this decision?

And while it isn't always black and white, the extra context and understanding of a new opinion is always beneficial. Sometimes it's just nice to have the space to air those thoughts out before they're thoughts. Like I do right here!

Now brb, I'm going to throw this into AI so it can tell me if I misspelled anything (because I'm lazy and write in GitHub files directly and there's no auto-correct). 

Also for some general content reviews and to see how my writing comes across because you know, I'm working on my writing I guess.

So yeah. AI isn't quite making my decisions for me. We'll leave that to a tiny-robot squirrel in 30 years. In the meantime, it's teaching me how to approach things better. And that's big.
