## What Work Travel is Actually Like
### believe it or not, exhausting
After a month back home, I’ve found myself back on the road in ~~The City of Brotherly Love~~ Baltimore. I was both excited for and dreading this trip, and for good reason.

Cons:

1.) This is the **longest on-site trip** we typically take (5 days).


2.) We fly out on a Saturday and back on a Sunday.


3.) Early mornings working on lumber yard hours.


4.) Days where all you want to do is crash, but you still have work to do.



Pros:

1.) My hotel is within walking distance of the city.


2.) The project shouldn't be too bad.


3.) Free food.

Laying it out like this is interesting because people often ask how I feel about work travel. Honestly, these days, _I’m a little mixed._

### Pros
There are times when work travel is great. I love being on-site with clients, making sure we’re aligned, and catching potential issues before they blow up.

> Like the time a customer went live on our inventory software, which requires scanning labels, without Wi-Fi in half their yard. 
> Oh, and their labels disintegrated when wet. And they were in Canada. In January. You can guess how that went.

Another huge perk is the financial side. From the second I leave my house, my net spend is positive. We get per diem in cash, meaning whatever I don’t spend is mine to keep. 

Since I’m pretty frugal, I usually come home with extra money. But if I wanted, I could splurge on a nice dinner or a night out.

Speaking of which, I checked out James Joyce Irish Pub last night. Cool vibe, solid Irish beef stew, but not worth $90 after tip for three beers, an appetizer, and dinner. 

I’d rather save my money for those rare nights when we’re out with a team or a generous client, where meals can run $100+ per person—on someone else’s dime. Now that’s a highlight.

Then there are the travel perks. Last year alone, I racked up about $4,000 in Marriott and Delta points, plus solid cashback rewards on my credit cards. 

Free flights, hotel upgrades, and lounge access definitely make all the flights and long days a little sweeter.

That said, the biggest factor in whether a trip is enjoyable is the city and how much energy I have left after a full day. Even in an amazing city, if I’m wiped out, I’m probably just ordering UberEats and passing out in my hotel. 

With our typical travel schedule—four 2-day trips and one 5-day trip per project—the short trips are easier to enjoy, but the long ones are a coin flip.

### Cons
**God, I’m tired.**__

The worst part? The exhaustion. Travel days often mean eight hours of planes and airports on both ends of the trip. If I couldn’t sleep on planes, my job would be so much harder.

Hotel sleep? Also not great. Some nights, I’m so wiped I crash instantly. Other nights, I toss and turn, running on fumes the next day. 

The only way to recover is skipping the city and just resting in my room, but even then, I try to time it so I’m exhausted enough to sleep on the flight home.

I also miss the consistency of home life:

Cooking and leftovers → I have to clear out my fridge before I leave.
Working out → Tough to keep a routine.
Waking up at the same time → Time zones and early client hours wreck this.
Making plans with friends → No one ever knows when I’m around.
It’s not that I get homesick—I love being on the road—but having a routine again after a long trip feels amazing. I should probably build better travel habits to make things easier...

And speaking of consistency, I can’t ignore the impact this would have if I lived with my partner.

Long-distance makes my travel schedule manageable, but if we were in the same place, constantly leaving, coming back, and adjusting plans would be a lot tougher. One of the hidden perks of our setup, I guess.

#### Final Thoughts
At the end of the day, I wouldn’t want to be fully remote. I like being face-to-face with customers—it makes my job easier, and I enjoy it. But I also have zero interest in going into an office every day, wearing pants, and pretending to enjoy meetings.

The hybrid balance works for me. Some days, I love being on-site. Other days, I just want to be home.

Overall, work travel is still an 8/10 for me. Even on bad trips—like my last one to Baltimore, which was a solid 3/10 — I still feel lucky to do this. The flexibility, the perks, and getting paid to take my job on the road? I’ll take it.
