## A Little Less Balti"more"
Haha get it? I tried to think of something snappy but Balti-less just felt like I was trying too hard. As of my last post, I was typing out my elation at arriving home after a long trip and have already found myself at my next jobsite, Baltimore, MD.

See, the thing about my job is that I get a lot of, "Wow how was it visiting XYZ?" and honestly? I normally respond with "tiring". I don't really get the chance to explore a lot of the cities I travel to and most of the time is spent in comatose rotting in Marriott's finest sheets following my days on site.

Spending 8-9 hours locked in mentally with clients, even if I can be myself and relax is draining. Tack on the 8 hour travel day on either side and you've got a homerun waiting for you in the form of takeout, some work, and laying in bed. Yesterday had a number of odd things happen at the airport while I was running out of patience, so I will highlight the most personally infuriating.

_The new SkyClub policy will be the death of me_.

Ah yes the SkyClub, an oasis of free drinks, average food, and mid-tier accommodations, which is at least better that waiting by the gate. These several thousand square ft "paradises" aren't for the wealthy or the elite, but the road warriors of America, strapped in to tackle whatever trip lay in front of them.

As of last year, anyone with an Amex Platinum or Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Card could access any Skyclub while flying Delta an unlimited number of times. This worked great for me as I probably visited 60 lounges this last year alone. I layoer on nearly every trip I take and took 25+ trips last year, so 60 lounges is a conservative estimate. Not to mention Indianapolis has a Skyclub I would use when I'm flying out (albeit dinky) that I will no longer be visiting.

The new changes will make this so that I can only go into a total of 15 SkyClubs this year (because I'm not spending 75k on your credit card delta, grow up, another stupid policy change).

The rant above has been stewing for over a month, but on a day I already didn't want to travel (yesterday), and only have 15 minutes before needing to board, I would've loved to grab a quick bite in the lounge like last year. Unfortunately, a measly 15 minutes isn't worth the $50 price tag (price per visit without the card, or now my 15 trips/year being estimated at that price in my head), so I decided to scarf down some food at the airport food court. What a humbling experience.

All that being said, I was just tired from getting off the back of my Europe trip and having been hitting the gym more frequently, airplane seats are starting to feel like a tighter squeeze. I also didn't get my beauty sleep on either plane and was a bit cranky, along with a 30min delay out of ATL and a 45 minute wait for the rental car shuttle at the BWI airport had me not in a great mood.

I'd also wanted to get into Baltimore and go straight to sleep, so my flight wasn't originally supposed to get in until 9:30pm (cue 10pm arrival). Add Avis preferred not having my rental car setup for me to walk straight out and add another 20min to my Journey when all I wanted was to sleep, yesterday felt like an eternity.

Add the long days on-site to a slightly pessimistic me, and there you are, a recipe for me to be *more than slightly* annoyed.

I'll be home for the next 2.5 weeks (long time at home for me!) before returning to Baltimore for my next trip, so my next few posts should be a bit more related to the hobbies I've missed the past month! Expect some cooking, long term planning, financial goals, and life reflections as the travel content will be on pause for a while. I do want to give some highlights from my time in the UK and Austria once I settle down, so those should be fun updates.

Signing off,
