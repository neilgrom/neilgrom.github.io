# Work and Current Projects

Just had a great day at work (From üè†) so I wanted to take the chance to talk about what I'm currently working on and a bit of what my job is like. As a software consultant, I'd like to think I have 4 different roles I assume throughout the project that all culminate in getting the customer live and share fairly equal parts.

1Ô∏è‚É£- 25% Teacher
2Ô∏è‚É£- 25% Navigating a bunch of parameters (check boxes) and testing what works for what they need
3Ô∏è‚É£- 25% SQL Database Resoures
4Ô∏è‚É£- 25% Strategic Advisor
(5Ô∏è‚É£) - 15% Concentrated power of will

Day to day, my role fluctuates heavily depending on whether I‚Äôm working remotely or visiting clients on-site in the US or UK‚Äîabout 25% of the time. Early on, I was offered a unique opportunity to lead UK projects. As a career move (and a free trip to Europe, let‚Äôs be real), it made perfect sense.

Why today went so well was because I've gotten to assist in all of the things related to touching our product in the UK, including some strategic planning and sales support. Today, I gave a nearly 3-hour product demo‚Äîa high-stakes moment since we‚Äôre trying to win the customer back. 

It‚Äôs always a challenge to balance showing off the tech, answering live questions, and making sure the customer actually sees the value without getting too technical. But when it clicks? That‚Äôs what makes consulting exciting. It's also nice to be able to sell the project with myself as the inevitable consultant.

Additionally, I've been overhauling our internal documentation for standized workflows over the past few days and got a done of that done today, so I'm exicted to get some tools done for the team to work more efficiently and deliver a better product for our customers at the end of the day. 

I can't say that I love my job because I love my company, but I definitely feel like I owe it to not just myself, but my customers paying for my time to deliver the best product possible. But my job is pretty sweet too.

# So What Software Do You Consult On?

Great question there reader. We build inventory software that keeps warehouses running smoothly. Picture an Amazon fulfillment center‚Äîwhen you order yet another impulse buy at 2 AM, a picker scans and grabs it. Our software does the same thing... just for lumber yards, hardware stores, and industrial suppliers.

We work on projects from start to finish in 9-12 month cycles which involve 5 on-site trips with 5 projects each, so that's on average a trip every two weeks along with some supporting coworkers project, we probably travel 30 weeks a year.

Lots of perks with that of course, such as airline points, hotel points, and credit card rewards, so I'm excited to dive into all of that soon enough in some future posts! 

This has been a good week for me and I'm excited to keep improving on what I've got and keep looking to push the boundaries of how to get better at the service I deliver to our customers.
