## One of my greatest strengths in terms of travel - if not life - is my ability to fall asleep pretty much on demand. You can thank the sleep apnea for that one mostly, but I mean just in general.

If I couldn't sleep on planes I think this job and my current lifestyle would be way more exhausting. Anywho, so I get on the plane today, and after finalizing my strategy over my last trip, I know pretty much exactly what to do in terms of getting on board, with the priority being getting some sleep.

Without this precious sleep, I pose an even greater threat driving on the other side of the road, which was known very well by the 2023 Mercedes Benz I rented the first time I was in the UK.

-Me, after hitting an unmoving object

Last night got off to a rocky start as I flew in from Vienna to Heathrow and checked into my hotel. Is what I would've said had I booked the correct one. Apparently, naming hotels after geographical features like airports isn't quite the goldmine you think it would be. I mean seriously guys, TWO Sheraton's within 2 miles of each other BOTH called Sheraton Heathrow? My bad, should've picked up on the "Sheraton Heathrow Hotel" and "Sheraton **SKYLINE** Hotel London Heathrow. Even ruined my strategy of taking the rental car shuttle instead of ubering, which would've been a 10min walk if I had booked the correct hotel. There goes $30 for the Ubers I had to call as a result over some stupid naming choices, which I will never forgive.

After this debacle, I was ready to crash. I took some melatonin as I boarded for my return trip from LHR -> JFK (-> IND), and slept for the first 2 hours of the flight. What a grave mistake indeed, as my punishment was a lack of sustenance provided for me as a meal. I spent the next 3 hours somewhat ruing my decision, and at least 2 hours waiting for food, scared of falling asleep and missing it again.

While the truffle mac and cheese was indeed bangin' (shout out Virgin Atlantic for the hookups), it felt like my entire day was centered around eating. Then, subsequently, failing to fall BACK asleep for the fear of missing food for the second time. Despite this unforgivable crime, the remainder of the trip back was fairly calm. 

With a 5 hour time difference to overcome, I'm back in Indy for ***checks watch*** 36 hours. I'll be frantically cleaning, relaxing, and prepping to fly out to Baltimore on Sunday for some more work.

It appears that the grind doesn't stop.
