# Self-Reflection: What's the End Goal?

I'm back from another (longer than expected) hiatus. I know the Argentina experience had me removed for nearly a month, then after only 2 posts back I already miss out on my post for the week?

I know that my reason for those breaks is an explain-away, so let me explain-it-away for you so I don't feel bad.

Getting out of my rhythm really hasn't put writing on my mind. See, I've spent the last few weeks slowly getting back into my routine on my return to Indy. With that return has come some life thoughts, general overview, and self-reflection.

If you've met me, you know that I'm a generaly reflective person. It's part of my desire to learn and grow and explore the world with a natrual curiousity. However, not all of these things are equal in terms of _how_ you grow and explore. I've found myself recently considering how I allocate my energy (and time, sleep mostly) against how I prioritize things in life.

I got thinking on this topic from a discussion I had with my brother earlier today. He had called to catch up, nothing serious. He had called me the night before so I wanted to make an effort to get back to him since I'm a terrible texter/communicator. 

I've finalized the idea of moving back in with my parents in a few months and had some other ideas I've been throwing around. For one of the first times when making a big decision, I didn't feel like I had to explain why to get people to believe I was making the right decision. 

And that was a big thing for me to come around to in the midst of a conversation. Especially with the background our parents instilled into me regarding expectations, which I always thought were very high regarding my success.

That's exhausting. Man I can be honest, I probably lived 23-ish years with that mindset and it (while helpful) wasn't ideal. I'd thought all these goals and things I sought to accomplish were just symbols of my competency as a person. A competency I belived was **necessary** to get what I wanted.

I will say I took it in an extreme manner with this idea of "success", and put my head down to drive through all the early goals I'd set for myself as a 19 year old for a 23 year old. It's crazy to look back at those things that little dreamer wanted me to do just so he could say he _did it_.

What a prick am I right? 

Besides that, I dreamed for things I thought about accomplishing where I never really thought about the next steps. And honestly, that makes sense. I don't know what got into me when I was 18. Probably the fact that I started living alone when I was 18 managing myself as a person... Nah I think it was high school soccer probably.

And now that I've accomplished those things, after not setting beyond the five years goals and realizing I can reset them whenever I want, I've set some new ones. A big one is that I've realized I need a change from Indy. 

It's been a great place to live, don't get me wrong, but the lifestyle I want isn't currently supported by my situation unless I want to put in alot more effort than would be comfortable for me. And that's a principal I've been seeming to loop back to recently.

Yes, I can sacrifice this idea or value or effort or 4 years of my life (like becoming a doctor, crazy right? Y'all people are crazy commited I didn't even know what I _needed_ at 19.) But that's just not worth it to me at this point.

I'm finally coming around to realize the value I get from how I choose to live my life and the numbers are crazy. The big topic pushing this discussion is me looking to pursue an MBA soon. Like seriously (lore drop).

The value this MBA adds and the effort of pursuing it is just a giant math problem to me. Which _*further lore drop*_ I spent most of my life doing Math because I was good at it, not because I wanted to. But, my mind perceives math in a somewhat automatic way, whether it be wrong or right. 

My roommate was talking to me about a commission fee for a house and instead of 3%, I spit out 30% in half a second and was immediately wrong. I don't know maybe I was hoping that math was important because I'd done it for so long I needed some validation.

The meaning of this is that the reason I am choosing to pursue this degree is because I've done the balance check on my life. I applied the quadratic formula, solved for X, and realized that I think the math adds up.

See, while I've been good at the numbers of math, I've never cared about the conceptual aspect of why it works. I remember my college professor giving me an example of a problem by deriving the formula, and I looked at him just clueless. My brain didn't care about how the equation was used other than an answer.

But now, I'm plugging the different variables that are my life into that equation and realizing the impact of my decisions. On the upside, committing to get an online degree in an advanced field would be time effective, cheap, and help me in my career.

On the downside, I get less time in this life **right now exploring this newfound sense of self.** And I get more time to chill and relax and walk through the tulips in this phase of live. So that's my question out of all of this.........

Where is my field of tulips? What's the situtation I want where I can look up from whatever I'm doing and love every second of it? Where I can take a deep breath, whatever I'm doing and realize, I've made it. This is what I've worked for, now I can just live.

Is that not getting this MBA and loving life right now _and_ in the future? Or is me deciding to get this degree and "sacrifice" some enjoyment of life? What if I actually want to do this? What if this is how I want to spend my time?

Ok I probaly would rather have some rot time to sit at home and watch anime. I've been watching One Pace - which is a condensed, re-cut of One Piece that cuts total watch time in half - recently. Definitely a good One Piece experience and would recommend.

But that's a luxury I get with my lifestyle is that I can do that fairly freely whenever I want. I almost feel like if I change a bit more of my life into productive time in the interrim, the more time I have to relax and reach that Tulip field. 

Lots of questions. At the end of the day, before talking with my brother, I thought I was going to do 1 online course starting in a month. He recommended I do 2 and realistically, my life slows down a lot in the summer. I think that makes sense.

I had initially chosen my goal as "hey just take a class and figure out if you like this." But knowing myself and my brother who has given me literally tons of details, if I'm going to do this, the time to start is right now.

So how bad do I want to do that? I'll need a few more weeks of reflection on that topic. But at the moment, I'm going to start it and work with my free time now to help out the me of the future. You're welcome big guy. Hopefully _you_ aren't a jackass.
