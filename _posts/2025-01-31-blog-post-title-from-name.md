Hey everybody! I‚Äôm back, and for the first time in what feels like forever, I‚Äôve finally had a chance to slow down. My latest trip to Baltimore wrapped up on Tuesday, marking the official end of what has been a truly chaotic five weeks of travel.

Here‚Äôs the whirlwind summary:

Spent Christmas in North Carolina with family (great to see everyone).
A few days back in Indy before heading off for:
        >1.) 1 week in California visiting my girlfriend (Santa Cruz, San Francisco).
        >2.) 2 weeks in the UK for work (lots of running around Eastern England).
        >3.) 1 week in Austria visiting a friend (Vienna, Graz).
So, naturally, the perfect way to follow up a month of near-constant travel was... yet another trip to Baltimore.

After all that, I got home yesterday and immediately started thinking about organization, optimization, and workflow efficiency. Because as much as I enjoy traveling, my on-the-go setup has been far from ideal‚Äîespecially after accidentally breaking my portable monitor while sleepwalking (yes, another story for another time).

That‚Äôs what today‚Äôs post is about: how I structure my computer, my workflow, and the tools I use to keep everything running smoothly. Maybe this turns into a proper guide one day. Maybe I shamelessly title it ‚ÄúHow to Organize Your Computer to Be More Efficient‚Äù for the clicks. Who knows.

But for now, let‚Äôs dive in to the tools I use on a daily basis to keep myself running smoothly.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Google Chrome Bookmarks  
If you're not using these already, you really need to start.  

Not only does bookmarking a link give you one-click access to your most utilized pages, but if you clear your history, you can type in the bookmark name up top in a pinch, which is handy for my brain a lot of the time. I have my work computer structured by my different projects/base/essential sites in different folders so I use that at least everyday.

I'm also interested in diving more into utilizing tab groups in Chrome, which are pretty much the ability to pull up multiple tabs at once with one click. Cool right? This also allows you to keep them organized and allows you to close the entire tab group and re-open it with a single click, pretty much saving a set of tabs together. My previous execution of this failed because I opened a bunch of client sites at once and they all used the same authentication and errored out over each other... So tbd on this one's effectiveness for me, but I see the potential again I think.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remote Desktop Manager  
Holy god this one is literally a miracle for me. We have soo many different clients to connect to and keeping track of all of those as different IP's and passwords and locations is a pain in the butt. While other people while probably use this tool _actually_ effectively, I use it just to dump the IP and description for each site which greatly streamlines the process of accessing multiple sites at once. 

You can have multiple RDP's open inside of RDP manager so they aren't all in separate RDP windows which is awesome, since we typically have multiple sites open at once anyway.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Outlook Efficiency  
One of the biggest changes I‚Äôve made recently is filtering emails as soon as they hit my inbox. This has made a massive difference in keeping things organized.

While it takes a little work up front, it allows me to quickly review the open tasks based on what‚Äôs still in that folder. If I don‚Äôt have an email for a specific task, I forward it to myself so it stays visible‚Äîsuper helpful. It's also good to get that lil' dopamine hit of moving the email into a folder to show the task is completed.

I also have my Outlook folders filtered by project, which is great for easy acccess to project information in a pinch. I am realizing I have some cross-over so some items aren't in the folders I'd expect them to be, so that needs to be ironed out, but worst case, the information is in one of two folder. I've also got a couple other folders, such as "Helpful Emails", "Template Emails to Send", and some automatic filters that take certain things out of my inbox so I don't have to manually move them.

Auto-filter rules are great for prioritizing emails that don‚Äôt need to be read immediately.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ To-Do List: Sticky Notes/OneNote  
As I began my consulting career, I found myself taking notes about every single detail, which overall may have enhanced my learning, but I've never actually revisited. I do revisit code snippets, old project setup, and functionality, but none of that is really done through OneNote. I use it as a sort of initial thought dump/landing page for meeting notes, and keep a centralized "To Do" list of everything that I can think of. This also keeps a task list of "nice things to do", which is non-essential work I can do to improve my own organization, or give time back to optimizing other resources for customers (IE: A Guide on how XYZ works) 

I keep a more (wow I just learned how you can insert emojis on accident üê§) daily sort of list on my Stick Notes App on my desktop to monitor. When I'm at home, I dump, similar to my sticky notes app, everything I need to get done, then organize it by importance and finish what I need to do. I think I've found a structure that works well for me here.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Helpful Customer Handouts Folder 
I would be remiss to not discuss this folder as it has literally become my world. Everytime I start a new project, the list of resources I provide for a customer grows. Partially as I realize more relevant information for what the customer is looking for, but additionally because I build resources as I need them. An example of a few documents I've created over the past year to help out customers (and bill for some time due to the operation of these tasks)
    >A Guide of how to navigate our web interface and helpful tabs
    >An excel sheet to calculate inventory variance and assist with the inventory process
    >Process documentation
    >System Options/Parameters required to make certain changes

Within my industry of consulting, our projects have life cycles of 9-12 months. This leaves a lot of room for variety, but a lot of the essentials are the same between projects for functionality and fundamentals. The more time I spend completing certain tasks, I realize certain information IS repeatable and that we need tools to better support our customers. Since my mind is geared for this and I can just drop that document to a customer the following time it is relevant, I'm happy to type up that solution for the first customer. I expect this folder to continue to grow and I hope to standardize that for my co-workers too to help us all impliment better projects.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Windows File Structure/Folder Organization  
While I feel as though my work file paths and locations are fairly structured behind different folders, I realized my desktop is extremely poorly optimized. I can still get exactly what I need when I need it from where, but it often takes clicking through several folders to get there. Because I'm always plugging/unplugging my computer, working on a portable monitor, and never on the same setup in terms of screen orientation, I don't really use my desktop, like EVER.

Which is crazy to admit. I have pretty much everything I need either on my task bar, on the search bar, bookmarked in Chrome, or in a folder somewhere. So I've revamped my home screen this past week to actually have specific shortcut folder I always use pinned to quick access and present on my home screen, so we'll see how it helps. I feel as though I'm always working with probably like 10 different apps open, so my homescreen is never visible hence the problem.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Shortcuts/Automation 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2d6aef0-1c2e-40c0-afd4-9094490ae104)

Now, the real reason for this post is what I spent several hours today working on, automation and efficient improvements. I realized I've been slowly modifying my systems to work for me and I came to the conclusion that there are a ton of different commands that I'm using ALL the time. For example, a basic SQL select statement where I always join the same two tables together, like as follows.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table1 t1  
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.ordernum = t2.ordernum  
LEFT JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.productcode = t3.productcode;
```

I originally thought, "What if I could type a customer name and have my computer default me to that customer's splash page in a chrome tab?" So I got curious, got exploring, and realized how easy it would be to setup a bunch of shortcuts to do that AND shorthand automation for pulling important code/information in flash.

I am 100% the guy who will spend 2 hours automating a 1-minute task, and man can I do the **crap** out of that with this. I type that query (or some form of it) at least once a day, which takes at least a minute. Using the software I'm trialing (TextBlaze), you can create your own shortcuts that automatically resolve into text. Meaning, I can create an sql bank of all my favorite queries and immediately pull them.

It's exciting/fun in a way because I feel as though I'm writing my own shorthand language at the moment. Like to get that above query snippet, I can simply type t123j, which would default into the standard join statement you see above. That's part of the automation I have unlocked and oh boy, the potential is crazy. I also have some email templates setup that look like this when I type in SchedCall which allow for filling in text.

As a consultant I do a ton of check-ups/check-ins so I wrote up a few template emails today and I will slowly be adding to this bank as I go. Here's what we've got right now as some different shorthand/functionality and I'm very excited to see the power I can pull from this.

The next step is to look into some software that I can go directly to certain browser links on, and build that out so that I can type %Customer1 and immediately get sent to a splash page of theirs. I'm still exploring the best fit for that software.

That's everything I've got in terms of how I enable myself to do my job better/faster. I'm excited to see the gain I'm going to get from TextBlaze from shorthand to text inserts to pulling up formatting for different sql queries as I get started.

Here's to working less and getting paid the same amount! (Hopefully)
