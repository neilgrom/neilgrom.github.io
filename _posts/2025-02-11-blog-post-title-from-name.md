Happy Tuesday everyone! Hope you are feeling optimistic during the most okay-ish day of the week.

I wanted to make this post a few days ago, but I managed to accidentally break the Archives Section of the blog and kinda freaked out. Im sure there will be **lots** of learning to figuring this all out, but it's working now at least.

_Hopefully I can convince some of my smart CS friends to help me..._

I wanted to make this post because the writing process has been interesting for this blog and it's already helped me learn some things about myself. See, I set out to write this not to make money, or to brag to others that I'm "the guy that has a blog".

***I refuse to become one of those people who goes around riffing about their blog... At least for now...***

I made this as a centralized place for reflection and growth, as well as a personal journal, and to look back at fond (and fondless? it's definitely not fondle...) times. What I've learned doing this recently has been that I love learning by trial and error.

Sort of like a video game, where you can get immediate feedback when you die that you weren't good enough at XYZ. Granted, not talking about Dark Souls there you masochists. I learned that while the process of growth is trying, I'm someone who likes to figure things out as they go.

And that's where the song ties into this, [**Nostalgia by Cal Scruby**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXtqpKo87d0). This song is a hip hop song with a reflective, cool tone and a mellow beat in the background. It reminds me of a lot of Kota The Friends stuff, with that laid back, easy delivery talking about life.

This song actually stood out to me the first time for a somewhat hilarious line that I'm sure I've told my friends multiple times over.

> "Got a shawty who model for Wilhelmina, she ain't Filipina, but she feel tha p*nis"

Definitely made me chuckle when I heard that one. Good on you Cal. But the part I want to highlight in the song comes a little later, after a brief break from the artist to hear some words from, what sounds like Tyler. The Creator, but we will assume someone on Cal's team.

> "That was when I realized I just gotta keep doing sh\*t.
> I was looking around for a long time, looking at other people.
> Like they were doing sh\*t right and I was doing sh\*t wrong.
> And then I realized nobody actually knows What the f\*k they're doing.
> But the people that succeed are the people that just keep doing it."

The line feels a little ironic/cheesy the first time around, but it really struck me hearing it recently as I'm figuring out how to move through life. There's no playbook for this thing. As someone who's felt like I haven't really had my own path before, I feel like I'm finding it and this quote makes me feel that.

I might not be doing anything to anyone else's speed or taste, but at the end I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, learning as I go, being curious, asking questions, and I know that I'll be someone who succeeds.

There's another quote immediately following this that I also think is quite interesting in this context.

>Nobody got the solution don't let them give you advice.
>They try to copy the sauce but, they ain't give it the spice
>See I mix in the wrongs they only mix in the rights
>Add everybody I lost and that's what give it the life
>That's the recipe, that's the best of me , that's a lesson not a loss It's God testin' me

It's really cool to hear these words coming from him following that idea of doing your own thing at your own pace and to just keep doing it. While I disagree about the advice bit, I do agree that no one has ever dealt with the **EXACT** same thing as you have.

While I get that people like to give advice from their own experience, no oneâ€™s ever lived your exact life. In my RA days, I learned to never say 'I empathize' because you never truly get the whole picture. But you can listen, learn, and support all the same while _sympathizing_ with them. 

His mention of mixing in the wrong and his struggles in life is also fascinating to me. I can't say my life has been perfect, although it's been pretty damn good, the things that have shaped me the most haven't been successes, but failures and things beyond my control I will never forget.

However, I can look at the back of those and even if it may not seem like a proud moment, I can be proud of what it has shaped me and the person I've become.

So thank you Cal. You're an independent artist who's just doing your own thing, chasing your life in a way I strive to. Godspeed my friend.
