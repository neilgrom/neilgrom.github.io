# Whew it's dusty in here.
![Alt Text](/Assets/racoon broom gif.gif) 

Don't mind me just cleaning up in here after not posting for _nearly a month_.

Ok, ok, I get it. I'm sorry. Ironically though, I don't feel like I have a good excuse for why I haven't posted in a bit. Here it is though if you're curious.

I've been down in Argentina visiting my girlfriend for the past few weeks which has been really nice. Since she's living in Buenos Aires, it doesn't feel like I'm a huge tourist.

Yes we're doing some touristy things and going to places she's only been to her first week living there. However, getting a unique view of someone who lives in a city abroad is a really cool glimpse into another world so to speak.

I feel like when I'm a tourist, it's been a lot of **go do that big thing. Yeah that one. Over there. Near all the other big things. Now do all the big things in the area.**

While there are a bunch of fantastic cities to go see big landmarks in, I found myself enjoying this trip being more of a local. A big part of it is not having seen my girlfriend in a few months and us both working, our days were pretty standard.

Wake up, work some, make breakfast/lunch, explore, cook dinner, or maybe grab dinner out, or make some plans with her friend. It made it feel a lot less stressful/tiring to just be somewhere different.

"Being here made me rethink how I balance productivity with enjoying the moment — especially when it feels like 'slacking off'

I'll be honest, I didn't feel like a great tourist this week. While there were a few things I wanted to do, including some markets and food stops, I'm mostly a figure things out a few days in advance of what I'm actually doing once I get there.

However, this past week we got to go on a trip to Salta, Argentina which was really cool! I'm actually writing this in the airport right now. Some pics and another post to follow, hopefully tomorrow.

In the act of getting distracted and having all of my surroundings totally changed, my habits/routines have fallen off. I haven't been to the gym in a few weeks, and the posts on here have been non-existent.

However, as I'm someone who more often than not sets out to accomplish what I commit to, I think this was a good setback for me. I still have goals of posting weekly and keeping this part of my routine to stay motivated, but I did feel like I slacked off a bit.

I'm not a slacker normally, but I feel as though my life goal these past 6 months or so have been to stop and smell the roses. 

Being out of my routine in a totally different environment, there were a few times I went "Damn is it Tuesday? Shoot I have to write a post!" before moving on to whatever I was doing.

While I did lose some focus, I think it's normal and honestly for me, healthy to prioritize living in the moment. While it's not healthy to neglect everything, finding that balance of loving live and pursuing passions that balance responsibilities is healthy.

It's a lot, but it's healthy. Thinking about refocusing on the blog in particular, I still want to try and make a post every week and I don't think 100 posts a year is too farfetch'd (get it?) with all the things I do.

Turns out, slacking off isn’t slacking at all when you’re busy living.

Stay tuned for some pictures and anecdotes about Buenos Aires over the next few weeks and here's to prioritizing what's important to prioritize, especially when you don't even realize it.
