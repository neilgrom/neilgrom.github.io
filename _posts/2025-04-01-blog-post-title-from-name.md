## Cooking (and planning) for 20+

Hey all! I just returned home from my three weeks in Argentina. I had a great time spending time with my girlfriend, cooking, exploring, and working on my Spanish. I can now (un)comfortably order food, and greet someone at different times of the day!

_That's about it for now.... I'll be working on Spanish for my next few trips for sure._

After writing my last post in the airport before boarding our plane, Abby and I ended up having our flight delayed by over 7 hours. We were lucky enough to be able to uber nearby and grab some food and drinks while watching Argentina vs. Brazil, which was a cool experience.

Now, back to a sense of normalcy, which is sleeping in my own bed, waking up at a somewhat consistent time, cooking, and working out more consistently. I got a great back workout in today even though it normally feels like one of my weaker areas which was awesome.

## Planning food for 20+

To celebrate getting back - along with move towards checking one of my to-do's off my bingo board for the year - I'm throwing a little get together this Saturday. I love hosting and creating a fun space for others. I enjoy cooking, hanging out, drinking, and catching up, all of which my parties lend themselves to.

I wanted to write this as a dumping ground of what goes through my mind and make my own checklist for what I need to buy/make along with have options for the future if I don't get to cooking everything on this list. Let's start with some easy ones, drinks!

### Drinks
-Jello Shots
  -> I've got some Jello Powder Downstairs, either Malibu or some flavored vodka, make 50 or so
    -> Fridge overnight on the day before, make Friday night
-24 Pack of Beer

That covers drinks. When I start planning my food menu, I typically start with apps and dessert and go from there since I normally do the same for those. 

### Appetizers
I do the same for appetizers most of the time, tried and true here.
-"Pop Tarts" - Flaky crescent rolls filled with cheese, jam, egg washed, and topped with sliced almonds and parsley
-Baked Brie -> This is a recipe my mom loves to make that I've inherited, need to grab some puff pastry dough
-Charcuterie Board Stuff
-Baked Mushrooms - Fun thought, can prep most of it before time, just have to see where we sit with different cook times and 

The big consideration when I'm planning/cooking main dishes is to spend as little time actually cooking in the kitchen as possible. It's normal to run around a bit to pull food from the oven, but I don't want to spend the whole time cooking while I could be spending time with my friends.

This means you have to think about rotating oven timings, prep work the day before, and making food that you can pretty much just throw in the oven. I've got my main oven, and 2 smaller ones as part of my Ninja along with an instant pot and air fryer.

### Entree
Typically, I stick with Pasta since it's easy and can be made en masse. In the past, I've made Bolognese and a cream-based alfredo pasta.

One dish I've made I really love is my "Marry Me Chicken" I pulled offline, which is just a cream based sauce with chicken and tortellini. I just plugged all the information into chatGPT and it seems doable as a baked dish rather than all the hands on cook time I normally do.

Make me excited to try this out if I can just dump it all into a baking dish and call it good. That's the main Entree settled then, Chicken + Tortellini. Now let's get another sort of entree and a GF/Veggie Option in there for people.

### Sides
I have this great little baked sheet pan potato recipe I love to make, so I'll do that one for sure.

Oven roasted veggies are also super easy and can be thrown on top of the pasta should need be, so add that.

An easy salad is also a good add here. I've never made Bruschetta before, so that could be fun. Also adding garlic bread would be easy. 

ChatGPT also gave me some suggestions for Eggplant Parm, which I've never made before but could be a fun challenge! I think that with an in-depth charcuterie board covers pretty much everything assuming I make two trays worth of the chicken, I can spice it up somehow.

Also a simple pasta with Red Sauce would be easy enough to bake or reheat later too with some breadcrumbs on top.

I think that's got us covered here! A little ambitious as always but that's how I do it!

### Dessert yum
So I always make a cheesecake, but I've mostly stayed in my comfort zone on this one. My mom used to make me a ton of cheesecake and always on my birthday so I've always been partial to her Oreo Cheesecake. I did recently spice some up by doing a peanut butter cheesecake and making a white chocolate ganache for another oreo cheesecake (fancy I know).

I do want to try the following at some point:
-Red Velvet Cheesecake
-Pistachio Cheesecake (Recipe a friend recommended)

But I think I'm going to go with a new idea, Smore's cheesecake. Oh yeah, that'll be a hit.

### Shopping List
-Ice for Coolers
-Puff Pastry Dough
-Malibu/Vodka for Jello Shots
-24 Rack
-Fruits for Charcuterie (Raspberries, Blueberries, Orange)
-Meats for Charcuterie (Aldi's finest BB)
-Crescent Rolls
-Crackers from Aldi
-Spinach
-Chicken Breast (4 lbs)
-Mushrooms
-Heavy Cream
-Tortellini
-Cheese
-Potatoes
-Olive Oil
-Sweet Potato
-Broccoli
-Red Onion
-Carrots
-Stuff for Smores Cheesecake
-More Pasta
-Soda/Fizzy Bevvies

Seems like a pretty good start to what I'm getting at. I'll have to figure out oven timings and actually go buy everything, but it's always a good time! I'll definitely be busy Friday/Saturday decorating and prepping, but it's always a good time.

It'll be a great chance to catch up with people I haven't seen in at least 3 weeks if not longer! I'll do my best to take some pictures and post them here with food (I'm actually gonna do it this time ok?)
