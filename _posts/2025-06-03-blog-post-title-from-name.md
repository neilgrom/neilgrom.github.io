# Well It's Been Awhile + Reflections

Hey all. I'll be honest, I was nervous to log back on here and post because of how long ago I remember my last post being. Like 3 months ago long was my fear. Turns out it's only been a month and a half! _Hah take that, me._

I'm writing today because I've had an awesome past month and a half, albeit busy. I went to the UK for a week, checked out the infamous town of Luton (yea that was a mistake), and generally did just work and no fun for two weeks.

I had my best friends visit me in Indy so I hosted them for a weekend. Then, I turned around and flew to Seattle for a week for work and to see the same friends ironically (thanks job). Finally, I flew back to Indy, started my MBA classes, and my girlfriend visited for two weeks.

Lots of change, lots of happenings over here. However, the point of today is to say that I'm here to put this blog to bed. For now, specifically this one here right now.

My first four weeks of my MBA program have been really good for me from a learning perspective - which is ironic as I really haven't "learned" a ton I feel like. I spent the last three weeks fighting with myself internally trying to figure out what the heck we're supposed to do here.

I've spent hours learning how to write which _**news flash**_ last time I wrote a paper for school was probably 8 years ago. Yeah wow, me too right? It's crazy because I've never had my own voice as a writer, at least academically so to speak.

This blog was a fun little side project to help me find that voice. As I started nitpicking work emails with ChatGPT and tightening my communication, this blog helped me find the fun part of writing. Where you can communicate that _feeling_ of the sentence you're building.

But that's not my thing. Too corny. However! If one of my sentences can make you laugh or stop and think about something, that's the voice I'm trying to find.

I've spent 20-25 hours (total, not per week lol) writing my discussion boards for school and while they're exhausting, I've learned _so much_ about myself and my style.

See, I'm an optimizer by nature. That nature and the flexibility of my current lifestyle has lead to an interesting challenge. It's a new environment and new chance to cut my teeth - and I'm way more prepared _and_ investested than my undergrad (thanks COVID). 

It feels like one of the first time in my life I've seen an objective and been able to set the bar **where** I want to. I know that's a seemingly impossible thought, but lets unpack it.

Growing up, I got good grades because I _thought_ my parents needed me too. They wanted me to sure, but I put that on myself. In college and my first job, it felt like the same, I wanted to do good because I wanted to do good, not because I **wanted** to be there. That's the big shift this time around, I want to do this.

As a result, if there are less desirable parts, I don't have to do them. There is nothing forcing me to do homework on a Sunday night if I don't want to. Granted it requires some luck and prep so you don't have to do that, but I can just say no now. 

That's the interesting part about this MBA is that I can apply myself and my better understanding of myself. I'm not going to learn by reading lecture slides with nothing but notes. I don't care if I get a B in a class, even though I would like an A.

The difference is I can build the structure around how I engage with these tasks. If I'm committed to an assignment, I can bust my tail to deliver a good result. However, I can look at a different assignment and say "wow that's boring" and do it to get it done aiming for a B.

That's the biggest difference of myself now as a professional from undergrad. I not only know how I work, but I know how to apply my effort relative to my engagement. There are things I won't want to do, but I don't have to try extra hard to do them anymore.

Apart from this style change, I've seen a lot of personal growth. Not just getting frustrated that a professor's teaching style isn't engaging for me, but now asking "how can **I** make it engaging for myself?"

I've been told I'm taking two writing heavy classes this quarter, which makes sense based on the work I'm putting in. Unfortunately, that means writing as a medium isn't really fun for me right now. Or my thing. But I tried!

This isn't the end for me as a writer. I think there's an itch deep down in my brain that I scratch every once and awhile where the words flying from my fingers are exactly what I want to say. However, this is the end for the GitHub Medium (for now). 

I think there's a future in which I return to writing via Substack, I thinkt that's a cool and fun place for my ideas. And maybe this will be the first time you're reading this post is over there as I'd migrate them all if I did it.

So here's to not losing focus, but watching some part things get blurry as the things you want to do come into the picture more clearly.
