# Well It's Been Awhile + Reflections

Hey all. I'll be honest, I was nervous to log back on here and post because I was nervous it was going to be toooooo long ago. Like several months territory. Turns out it's only been a month and a half! _Hah take that, me._

I wanted to sit down and write this today because I've had an awesome past month and a half, albeit busy. I went to the UK for a week, checked out the infamous town of Luton (yea that was a mistake), and generally did just work and no fun.

I had some of my best friends come to visit me in Indy so I hosted them for a weekend. Then I turned around and flew to Seattle for a week for work and to see the same friends ironically. Then, I flew back to Indy, started my MBA classes, and my girlfriend visited for two weeks.

Lots of change, lots of happenings over here. However, the point of today is to say that I'm here to put this blog to bed. For now, specifically this one here right now.

My first four weeks of my MBA program have been really good for me from a learning perspective - which is ironic to say as I really haven't "learned" a ton in my opinion. I have spent the last three weeks fighting with myself internally trying to figure out what the heck we're supposed to do here.

I've spent hours learning how to write which _news flash_ last time I wrote a paper for school was probably 8 years ago. Yeah wow me too right? It's crazy because I've never had my own voice as a writer, at least academically so to speak.

This blog was a fun little side project to help me find that voice. As I started looking over work emails more seriously and tightening up my communication, this blog helped me find the fun part of writing. Where you can create a sentence straight out of your brain for someone to read.

Ok yeah that's not my thing. Too corny. But if one of my sentences can make you laugh or stop and think about something, that's the voice I'm trying to find.

I've spent 20-25 hours writing my discussion boards the past three weeks and while they're exhausting, I've learned _so much_ about myself and my style.

See, I'm an optimizer by nature and it's lead to this MBA being the extension of a challenge against my current self. How far can I go with nothing but my wits and background in an unfamiliar world?

The answer is pretty far. I've already seen a lot of connections to my everyday life and a lot of the workplace reflections I'm having have been echoed by own own curiosity and this class.

Unfortunately, that means writing as a medium isn't really fun for me right now. Or my thing. But I tried!

This isn't the end for me as a writer. I think there's an itch deep down in my brain that I scratch every once and awhile where the words flying from my fingers are exactly what I want to say. However, this is the end for the GitHub Medium.

I think there's a future in which I return to writing via Substack, I thinkt that's a cool and fun place for my ideas. And maybe this will be the first time you're reading this post is over there as I'd migrate them all if I did it.

So here's to not losing focus, but watching some part things slowly go out of focus as you prioritize the things you chase in life.
