## Getting Started: Why Am I Doing This?

If you're reading this you've stumbled your way onto my passion project. I'm currently typing this from a hotel in London trying to wrap my head around shoving all the context I can into your head about why I'm doing this thing anyway.

The most obvious/apparent reason is timing. With New Year's around the corner and closing my first big chapter of my professional career, I got thinking about change. Specifically, why people don't finish these resolutions if they care enough to make them? While I've never been great at New Year's resolutions specifically, any ones I've made (typically going to the gym more) I always fail to follow through on. What did work was deciding that in July of this past year, I needed to get back in the gym again. Without my chaotic day to day travelling for my job and for fun, I had a stable platform to get my mind and body right. I highlight this because it expresses me, and how I need to drive change by doing things _I_ want to do for myself.

One image that comes to mind related to this is a sort-of picturesque movie scene. After overcoming many trials, the main character finds themself sharing profound things they've learned about themselves to their mentor. And the first thing out of their Sensei's mouth is...

"**I know.**"

That sort of weird, calming, yet troubling comment. It seemed foreign, or almost rude to me the first time I envisioned something like this. "You shoulda told him earlier!!! Why'd we just spend an hour watching them got through all that mess just to get here?" But after it happened to me, **I understand it now**. Leaving school, I got my degree in Civil Engineering, moved halfway across the country, restarted my life and realized I _hated_ my job. And while that is dramatic, I didn't hate it because I hated every minute I spent working there, I hated it because it was boring and I didn't like the work itself. The points I despised the most were the ones I spent what felt like 8 hours a day doing. After realizing I couldn't do it anymore, I started bulking up my resume, sending out applications, and bringing the topic up in front of whoever would listen. When I expressed this frustration and apathy on a family call, my brother made me feel the same way. 

> "I was wondering when you were gonna figure that out". 

There it was. Those words delivered by a sort of Master Shifu to an eagerly confused Dragon Warrior. Having put my head down, applied to jobs, and found some competitive offers, I landed the job I have now ~~teaching Amish people how to use phones~~ as a Software Consultant. It's the journey to get to this destination that has made the aforementioned scenario so meaningful. Because Matt could've told me that he knew I wasn't going to make it very long as an engineer, but what would that have done? It might've spurred my ego to try and prove him wrong, or moved out of engineering so fast I lacked the passion to pursue something different.

The reason for that whole schpiel is because this example made me realize that I need to want to explore the things I'm doing. Finding natural connections to things that intrigue me, maybe like what engineering was for a lot of my colleagues that I didn't understand. **I'm curious for the first time in my life.**

This blog will cover all of my different curiousities and funny stories along with the learning along the way. I want this blog to feel like my creative dumping ground for future reference. While it's still early, I want to do topics on the things that I love, such as cooking, guitar, board games, travel, work, finances, funny stories, writing, etc. I'll probably have a sort of manifesto/working documents with topics and ideas and future content or a sort of table of contents for all the technical improvements I'd like to make to the GitHub page if you're ever curious for a sneak peak.

You can tell it's going to be a lil _tipsy_ in this b*tch. 

I did want to give credit to the person who I found this template from to begin building the website from a similar project by a user called [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). Go give his page a visit if you're curious about how to get started on your own blog.


Well that's all for now, but I hope that you have a better idea of what we're both getting ourselves into here.
