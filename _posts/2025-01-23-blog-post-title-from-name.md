## Why Are You Doing This?

If you're reading this you've stumbled your way onto my passion project. As I type this, I sit from my hotel room in here in London trying to wrap my head around shoving all the context I can into your head about why I'm doing this thing.

The most obvious/apparent reason is timing. With New Year's around the corner and closing my first chapter of big accomplishments in my professionalI got thinking about change. Specifically, why people don't finish these resolutions if they care enough to make them? For myself, I realized that I can't just do something because someone is telling me to. I need that spark of whatever it is to want to do it myself.

One thought that comes to mind is a sort-of picturesque movie scene where the main character finds themself with their mentor and shares something profound about their own life and how the mentor has helped them. And the first thing out of that persons mouth is...

"I know."

That sort of weird, calming, yet troubling comment. It seemed foreign, or almost rude to me the first time I envisioned something like this. "You shoulda told him earlier! Why'd he have to go through all that to get here?" But after it happened to me, I get it. Leaving school, I got my degree in Civil Engineering, moved halfway across the country, restarted my life and realized I _hated_ my job. And while that is dramatic, I didn't hate it because I hated every minute I spent working there, I hated it because it was boring and I didn't like the work itself. The points I despised the most were the ones I spent what felt like 8 hours a day doing. After finally realizing I couldn't do it anymore, I started bulking up my resume, sending out applications, and bringing the topic up in front of whoever would listen. When I expressed this frustration and stagnation and general apathy on a family call, my brother said that too. 

"I was wondering when you were gonna figure that out". 

There it was. Those words that nearly 3 ago I didn't understand, I finally get now. Having put my head down, applied to jobs, and found some competitive offers, I landed the job I have now ~~teaching Amish people how to use phones~~ as a Software Consultant. It's the journey to get to this destination that has made the aforementioned scenario so meaningful. Because Matt could've told me that he knew I wasn't going to make it very long as an engineer, but what would that have done? It might've spurred my ego to try and prove him wrong, or move so fast I lacked the passion to pursue something different.

The reason you're reading this right now is because I've finally learned to explore things that make me curious (at least 7 years too late). This blog will cover all of my different curiousities and learning that I'm doing, while teling anecdotal stories and thought provoking questions I have to type out to myself. I want this blog to feel like my creative dumping ground for future reference. While it's still early, I want to do topics on the things that I love, such as cooking, guitar, board games, travel, work, finances, funny stories, writing, etc. I'll probably have a sort of manifesto/working documents with topics and ideas and future content or a sort of table of contents for all the technical improvements I'd like to make to the GitHub page if you're ever curious for a sneak peak.

You can tell it's going to be a lil _tipsy_ in this b*tch. 

I did want to give credit to the person who I found this template from to begin building the website from a similar project by a user called Chad Baldwin. Go give his page a visit if you're curious about how to get started on your own blog.

Well that's all for now, but I how that you have a better idea of what we're both getting ourselves into here.
