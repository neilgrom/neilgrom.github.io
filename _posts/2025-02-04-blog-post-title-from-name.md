# What I did this Week

As I'm typing this, I started this post by using some shortcuts I'd setup from TextBlaze to populate some rather long, boring info for the post sorting. This will definitely be something that's going to save me some time going forward.

If you're reading this post, hello! Thanks for coming back and checking up on what I'm doing. I was genuinely curious about my last post discussing workflow organization and diving into what it would take to learn to make me more efficient with the work I'm doing.

There were a lot of good suggestions from friends I'd met that I would like to explore, including GPT (which, fun fact, stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) integration for summarizing tasks like with Microsoft Copilot, or the more obvious answer, Microsoft Power Automate.

## What is Power Automate?

Power Automate is software that is integrated within the Microsoft Suite that can perform certain actions when you run the program, or by an automatic trigger. The most useful example I can come up with of how this is used in my current workplace is to send out a weekly timecard reminder email every Friday at 3:00pm.

Now I'll be honest, looking at the picture above seems pretty nightmare inducing for most people. Honestly, it was for me too as I spent 3 hours rolling my face against a keyboard watching YouTube Videos, trying to use ChatGPT for help, and testing through it breaking every 2 minutes.

However, I can now proudly say I wrote my first script! It's not perfect, but the idea has potential. Here's how it works.

-  Summarizes all sent emails in one sentence
-  Dumps that into an excel sheet based on a date range specified
-  Provides quick visuals to project details, summaries, timestamps, and invovled parties.
-  Has potential to integrate into tracking times for teams meetings and other app opening. 

### So Why Does This Matter?

Great question. At the moment, it really doesn't. Right now, I am a little baby bird desperately holding my mouth up to the sky begging for any information to be regurgitated into my mouth. But, the available concepts/efficiencies to pursue behind this tool are

1️⃣ **Automating tedious tasks = more time for real work.**  
2️⃣ **Scalability:** If I can automate **time tracking**, what else can I optimize?  
3️⃣ **Coding mindset:** Power Automate is a stepping stone into **no-code/low-code automation**, which could lead to bigger projects.  

### Bring 'er Home, Scotty

In myfirst post "Why Do I Blog" (linked here if you haven't read it yet) -> https://neilgrom.github.io/2025/01/23/blog-post-title-from-name.html I iterated how I'd just learned how curious I was. After completing the task above in Power Automate, I found out I _love_ learning by trial and error.

Having a machine immediately spit back a "You got it right!" or "syntax error you goob" is a very positively infuriating, yet beneficial experience. It's learning to speak another language, and while you might not know if you're doing it 100% right, you'll definitely know when you're wrong.

And that's something I'm excited for! As I build this website and blog out further and advance my skills in other areas, I am looking forward to figuring it out as I go, and no one's going to stop me when I get that itch.
